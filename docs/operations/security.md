# Agent99 Framework

## Security

While Agent99 focuses on communication efficiency, it is recommended to implement security measures like:

- Encrypting messages in transit.
- Using secure protocols for messaging (e.g., AMQPS or NATS with TLS).
- Implementing access control mechanisms for sensitive operations.
