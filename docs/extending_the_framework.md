# Agent99 Framework

## Extending the Framework

To extend Agent99:

1. Implement custom modules and include them in your agents.
2. Define new message types or schemas as needed.
3. Use hooks to add functionality or override existing behavior.

If a plugin system is developed in the future, it would allow for additional features without modifying the core framework.
