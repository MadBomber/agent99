# Agent99 Framework

## Messaging Systems

Agent99 supports both AMQP and NATS for messaging. Switching between messaging backends can be easily done through configuration:

- Use environment variables to set the messaging protocol you wish to configure.
- Choose the appropriate messaging client implementation upon initialization of the agent.
