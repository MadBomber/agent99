# Documentation

TODO: Lets get some more detailed documentation underway that can be linked to from the main README.md file.

Here are some key areas that should be covered in comprehensive documentation files:

1. Architecture Overview:
   - Explain the overall structure of the AiAgent framework
   - Describe the roles of different components (Base, MessageClient, RegistryClient, etc.)
   - Illustrate how agents communicate and interact within the system

2. Agent Lifecycle:
   - Detail the process of creating, initializing, running, and shutting down an agent
   - Explain the registration and withdrawal process with the registry service

3. Message Processing:
   - Describe the different types of messages (request, response, control)
   - Explain how messages are routed and processed
   - Detail the schema validation process for incoming messages

4. Agent Discovery:
   - Explain how agents can discover other agents based on capabilities
   - Describe the process of querying the registry for available agents

5. Control Actions:
   - List and explain all available control actions (shutdown, pause, resume, etc.)
   - Describe how to implement custom control actions

6. Configuration:
   - Detail all configuration options available for agents
   - Explain how to use environment variables for configuration

7. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Describe the error handling mechanisms in place
   - Explain how to configure and use the logging system effectively

8. Messaging Systems:
   - Provide details on both AMQP and NATS messaging systems
   - Explain how to switch between different messaging backends

9. Custom Agent Implementation:
   - Provide a step-by-step guide on creating a custom agent
   - Explain how to define capabilities, handle requests, and send responses

10. Schema Definition:
    - Explain how to define and use request and response schemas
    - Provide examples of complex schema definitions

11. Performance Considerations:
    - Discuss any performance optimizations in the framework
    - Provide guidelines for writing efficient agents

12. Security:
    - Explain any security measures in place (if any)
    - Provide best practices for securing agent communications

13. Extending the Framework:
    - Describe how to add new features or modify existing functionality
    - Explain the plugin system (if one exists)

14. Troubleshooting:
    - Provide a list of common issues and their solutions
    - Explain how to debug agents effectively

15. API Reference:
    - Provide a comprehensive API reference for all public methods and classes
