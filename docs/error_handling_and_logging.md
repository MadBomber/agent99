# Agent99 Framework

## Error Handling and Logging

Agent99 incorporates robust error handling mechanisms, with error messages being captured and logged. The logging system is configured through environment variables to define the logging level and output destination.

Example:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

Logs provide insights into agent activities, including errors encountered during message processing and system events.
