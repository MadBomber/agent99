# RegistryClient Documentation

## Overview

The RegistryClient class is a crucial component of the Agent99 framework, providing a Ruby interface to interact with the Central Registry service. It encapsulates the HTTP communication logic required to register agents, discover capabilities, and manage agent lifecycle within the Agent99 ecosystem.

## Class: Agent99::RegistryClient

### Initialization

```ruby
def initialize(base_url: ENV.fetch('REGISTRY_BASE_URL', 'http://localhost:4567'),
               logger: Logger.new($stdout))
```

Creates a new instance of the RegistryClient.

- `base_url`: The URL of the Central Registry service (default: http://localhost:4567)
- `logger`: A logger instance for output (default: stdout logger)

### Public Methods

#### register

```ruby
def register(name:, capabilities:)
```

Registers an agent with the Central Registry.

- `name`: The name of the agent
- `capabilities`: An array of capabilities the agent possesses
- Returns: The UUID of the registered agent

One of the first improvement that should be considered when registering a new agent is adding its JSON schema for its request and response messages.  This way there should be no question about how to interface with the agent.

#### withdraw

```ruby
def withdraw(id)
```

Withdraws an agent from the Central Registry.

- `id`: The UUID of the agent to withdraw
- Returns: nil

#### discover

```ruby
def discover(capability:)
```

Discovers agents with a specific capability.

- `capability`: The capability to search for
- Returns: An array of agents matching the capability

#### fetch_all_agents

```ruby
def fetch_all_agents
```

Retrieves all registered agents from the Central Registry.

- Returns: An array of all registered agents

### Private Methods

The class includes several private methods for handling HTTP requests and responses:

- `create_request`: Creates an HTTP request object
- `send_request`: Sends an HTTP request and handles exceptions
- `handle_response`: Processes the HTTP response based on its status code

## Usage Example

```ruby
client = Agent99::RegistryClient.new
agent_id = client.register(name: "TextAnalyzer", capabilities: ["sentiment analysis", "named entity recognition"])
matching_agents = client.discover(capability: "sentiment analysis")
client.withdraw(agent_id)
```

## Potential Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Implement more granular error handling and custom exceptions for different types of failures (e.g., network errors, authentication errors).

2. **Retry Mechanism**: Add a retry mechanism for transient failures, potentially using a library like `retriable`.

3. **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling to improve performance when making multiple requests.

4. **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data, such as the list of all agents or common capability searches.

5. **Asynchronous Operations**: Provide asynchronous versions of methods for non-blocking operations, possibly using Ruby's `async`/`await` syntax or a library like `concurrent-ruby`.

6. **Pagination Support**: Implement pagination for methods that return potentially large datasets, such as `fetch_all_agents`.

7. **Capability Normalization**: Normalize capabilities (e.g., lowercase, remove whitespace) before sending to ensure consistent matching.

8. **Batch Operations**: Add support for batch registration or withdrawal of multiple agents in a single request.

9. **Logging Enhancements**: Improve logging to include more detailed information about requests and responses for better debugging.

10. **Configuration Options**: Allow more configuration options, such as timeout settings, custom headers, or SSL/TLS options.

11. **Capability Validation**: Implement client-side validation of capabilities before sending requests to the server.

12. **Agent Status Updates**: Add methods to update an agent's status or capabilities without full re-registration.

13. **Metrics Collection**: Integrate with a metrics library to collect and report on API usage and performance.

14. **Authentication Support**: Add support for authentication mechanisms if the Central Registry implements them in the future.

15. **API Versioning**: Implement support for API versioning to handle potential future changes in the Central Registry API.

By implementing these improvements, the RegistryClient can become more robust, efficient, and feature-rich, enhancing its utility within the Agent99 framework.
