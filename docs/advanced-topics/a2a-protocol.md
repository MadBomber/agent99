# Agent to Agent (a2a) Protocol

Google just pulically announted their A2A public protocol for inter-agent coordination and discovery.  Its a pretty thick specification much heavier and more complete that what is being proposed here within the Agent99 reference implementation; however, it is at the highest levels consistent with a centralized well-known server, use of HTML for inter-agent communication payloads of JSON packages; and, of course, agents a hetro implementations from anywhere but having the one communication standard in common.
