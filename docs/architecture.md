# Agent99 Framework

## Architecture Overview

Agent99 is a Ruby-based framework designed specifically for building and managing software agents in a distributed system environment. The architecture leverages a service-oriented approach, where agents are able to register themselves, discover other agents, and communicate directly through a peer-to-peer messaging system. This document outlines the key components of the Agent99 framework and provides guidance for both new developers and experienced users looking to integrate with the framework.
### Overall System Architecture

In Agent99, the architecture can be viewed as a microservices-oriented structure where each agent acts as a distinct service. Agents interact with each other via direct messaging facilitated by the selected messaging system, while registration and discovery processes are managed through the central registry service. This architecture promotes scalability, allowing multiple agents to work independently and collaboratively, executing tasks efficiently across the network.

### Communication Workflow

1. **Registration**:
   - When a new agent is created, it registers itself with the central registry. Upon successful registration, it receives a unique UUID through which it can communicate with other agents.

2. **Service Discovery**:
   - Agents can query the central registry to find other agents that provide specific services. This ensures that tasks can be delegated to suitable peers based on their capabilities.

3. **Direct Messaging**:
   - Using the MessageClient, agents can send and receive messages directly to each other, utilizing the configured messaging backend for reliable communication.
